@article{Skousen1997,
abstract = {A reflection of the economics profession through Paul Samuelson's Economics. Samuelson offers an uneasy mix of laissez faire in micro and government interventionism in macro. In earlier editions, Keynesian thinking dominated, with an antisaving, progovernment bias and a need for an activist fiscal policy aimed at alleviating unpredictable chronic business cycles under private enterprise. Middle editions had chapters on the Soviet Union and China, rather than Japan and West Germany. Recently, Samuelson and coauthor William Nordhaus have gradually shifted from antithrift to prosavings policies, from deficit spending to fiscal restraint, and from fiscal policy to monetary policy as effective countercyclical tools.},

abstract = {This paper, following Kaldor's approach, is written with the intention of interpreting fluctuations of economic systems (i.e trade cycles). In particular, a new discretized Kaldor model is proposed, which is also useful to explain what appears to be random and unpredictable, such as economic shocks. Moreover, by using numerical analysis, the chaoticity of the model is demonstrated.},

abstract = {It is shown that the discrete-time version of the neoclassical one-sector optimal growth model with elastic labor supply and standard monotonicity and convexity assumptions on technology and preferences can have periodic solutions of any period as well as chaotic solutions. The optimality of these non-monotonic solutions is traced back to strong income effects. When technology and preferences are parameterized as it is commonly done in quantitative macroeconomic studies, these phenomena cannot occur.},

@article{King1998,
abstract = {Many linear rational expectations macroeconomic models can be cast in the first-order form, AEtyt+ 1 =Byt + CEtxt, if the matrix A is permitted to be singular. We show that there is a unique stable solution under two requirements: (i) the determinantal polynomial JAz -B I is not zero for some value of z, and (ii) a rank condition. The unique solution is characterized using a familiar approach: a canonical variables transformation separating dynamics associated with stable and unstable eigenvalues. In singu-lar models, however, there are new canonical variables associated with infinite eigenvalues. These arise from nonexpectational behavioral relations or dynamic identities present in the singular linear difference system.},
