abstract = {This paper discusses the role of lags in dynamic economic models. Applications of discrete dynamical systems to economics are considered and the shortcomings of their (implicit) treatment of lags are criticized. An abstract, probabilistic view of lags is then provided, within which fixed delay lags are shown to be a special case. A basic equivalence is proved between: (i) a system with an indefinitely large number of agents, reacting to inputs with randomly gamma distributed, discrete lags, and (ii) a system with one single ‘representative‘ agent reacting to inputs with a continuous, multiple exponential lag. Finally, the paper analyses a single-loop feedback system cuopling a multiple exponential lag and a non-linearity of the one-hump type. The dynamic behavior of the system is studied by means of analytical and numerical methods, and the conditions for periodic and chaotic solutions are investigated.},

abstract = {This lecture describes recent theoretical developments associated with the dynamics of flames, obtained primarily by exploiting the various temporal and length scales involved in the combustion process. In premixed flames the focus is on flame-flow interactions that occur during the nonlinear development of hydrodynamically unstable large-scale flames, or during the propagation of curved flames in two-dimensional channels. The second part of the paper deals with non-premixed and partially premixed flames, where the focus is on understanding the nature of diffusive-thermal instabilities including the effect of thermal expansion, and on stabilization mechanisms of edge flames, which possess characteristics of both premixed and diffusion flames. The results presented in this talk illustrate how simplified models, when analyzed to their extreme, yield predictions of qualitative nature with physical insight that have advanced our understanding of combustion. This insight can be used to guide the experimental efforts, explain observations and validate large-scale numerical simulations. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Combustion Institute.

The motivations that have generated it, describing a whole of interdependencies, interactions, are clear and convincing. But a question remains: if the situation is so clear a posterior why economists have not been able to foresee it? What is happening to economic science if it is not able to recognize an economic crisis before it "steps on it"? How is it possible that the economic science was caught off guard yet again? Besides, what is the implication for the status of economics as a science if it is not able to successfully deal with real economic problems? The aim of the paper is to show the weakness of traditional economic theory and what improvements in terms of description and foresight could be obtained applying chaos theory to the study of economic phenomena.

abstract = {Whether there is a trade-off between price and financial stability is an open question. This paper characterises optimal monetary policy analytically in a New Keynesian economy with capital and a financial accelerator. In addition to stabilising inflation, there is an incentive to smooth volatility in the net worth of borrowers and this presents a trade-off for monetary policy. This trade-off can be eliminated if policymakers can additionally choose an optimal transfer to borrowers. Enriching the model with fire sales and countercyclical bankruptcy costs, there is also an incentive to smooth volatility in default and the capital stock. An optimal transfer to borrowers is not sufficient to eliminate the trade-off in that case. With fewer instruments than targets, optimal transfers are state contingent and countercyclical, while monetary policy stabilises inflation.},

abstract = {Combining deep model-free reinforcement learning with on-line planning is a promising approach to building on the successes of deep RL. On-line planning with look-ahead trees has proven successful in environments where transition models are known a priori. However, in complex environments where transition models need to be learned from data, the deficiencies of learned models have limited their utility for planning. To address these challenges, we propose TreeQN, a differentiable, recursive, tree-structured model that serves as a drop-in replacement for any value function network in deep RL with discrete actions. TreeQN dynamically constructs a tree by recursively applying a transition model in a learned abstract state space and then aggregating predicted rewards and state-values using a tree backup to estimate Q-values. We also propose ATreeC, an actor-critic variant that augments TreeQN with a softmax layer to form a stochastic policy network. Both approaches are trained end-to-end, such that the learned model is optimised for its actual use in the tree. We show that TreeQN and ATreeC outperform n-step DQN and A2C on a box-pushing task, as well as n-step DQN and value prediction networks (Oh et al. 2017) on multiple Atari games. Furthermore, we present ablation studies that demonstrate the effect of different auxiliary losses on learning transition models.},

The present study investigated in patients with major depression (MD) whether the subscales are a comparable option to predict treatment remission in the early course of treatment.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Based on data from 210 MD patients of a 6-week randomised, placebo-controlled trial comparing mirtazapine (MIR) and paroxetine (PAR), the discriminative and predictive validity of EI for (stable) remission at treatment end was evaluated for seven subscales and the HAMD17 in the total and in treatment subgroups (MIR vs. PAR). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves (at week 2) and the Clinical Global Impression scales (CGI) (at study endpoint) were used to validate the 20{\%} EI criterion for the subscales.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Only the Evans6 and Toronto7 subscale had almost the same predictive value as the HAMD17 (e.g., sensitivities stable remission Evans6/Toronto7: 96/95{\%} vs. 96{\%} HAMD17). The optimal cut-off for EI to predict remission was just below 20{\%} for most subscales and slightly over 20{\%} for stable remission.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLIMITATIONS: Study sample representativeness, non-independence of subscales, missing external validation criterion, lack of control group.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The Evans6 and Toronto7 subscales are valuable alternatives in situations, where economic aspects play a larger role. A sum score reduction of ≥20{\%} as definition for EI seems also appropriate for the HAMD subscales, in the total as well as in the antidepressant subgroups.},

However, Metzler assumes that producers are homogeneous and follow a simple expectation formation rule. Taking into account that in reality producers might not only follow several expectation formation rules, but might also even switch between them, we reformulate Metzler's original model. As it turns out endogenous business cycles may emerge within our model, i.e. changes in production and inventory are (quasi-)periodic for certain parameter combinations. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Aubin2002,
abstract = {Between the late 1960s and the beginning of the 1980s, the wide recognition that simple dynamical laws could give rise to complex behaviors was sometimes hailed as a true scientific revolution impacting several disciplines, for which a striking label was coined-"chaos." Mathematicians quickly pointed out that the purported revolution was relying on the abstract theory of dynamical systems founded in the late 19th century by Henri Poincar{\'{e}} who had already reached a similar conclusion. In this paper, we flesh out the historiographical tensions arising from these confrontations: longue-dur{\'{e}}e history and revolution; abstract mathematics and the use of mathematical techniques in various other domains. After reviewing the historiography of dynamical systems theory from Poincar{\'{e}} to the 1960s, we highlight the pioneering work of a few individuals (Steve Smale, Edward Lorenz, David Ruelle). We then go on to discuss the nature of the chaos phenomenon, which, we argue, was a conceptual reconfiguration as much as a sociodisciplinary convergence. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

abstract = {This paper develops a dynamic general equilibrium model that is intended to help clarify the role of credit market frictions in business fluctuations, from both a qualitative and a quantitative standpoint. The model is a synthesis of the leading approaches in the literature. In particular, the framework exhibits a financial accelerator,' in that endogenous developments in credit markets work to amplify and propagate shocks to the macroeconomy. In addition, we add several features to the model that are designed to enhance the empirical relevance. First, we incorporate money and price stickiness, which allows us to study how credit market frictions may influence the transmission of monetary policy. In addition, we allow for lags in investment which enables the model to generate both hump-shaped output dynamics and a lead-lag relation between asset prices and investment, as is consistent with the data. Finally, we allow for heterogeneity among firms to capture the fact that borrowers have differential access to capital markets. Under reasonable parametrizations of the model, the financial accelerator has a significant influence on business cycle dynamics.},

We use this approach to address how fiscal and monetary policy should be set over the long run and over the business cycle. We find four substantive lessons for policymaking: Capital income taxes should be high initially and then roughly zero; tax rates on labor and consumption should be roughly constant; state-contingent taxes on assets should be used to provide insurance against adverse shocks; and monetary policy should be conducted so as to keep nominal interest rates close to zero. We begin optimal taxation in a static context. We then develop a general framework to analyze optimal fiscal policy. Finally, we analyze optimal monetary policy in three commonly used models of money: a cash-credit economy, a money-in-the-utility-function economy},

We apply this model to the logistic map and examine the behavior of the control parameter. We find that the parameter leaves the chaotic regime.

Second, models with both staggered price and wage setting dominate models with only price rigidities. Third, introducing wage indexation does not significantly improve the fit. Fourth, all model estimates suggest a high degree of price stickiness. Fifth, the estimates of labor supply elasticity are higher in models with both staggered price and wage contracts.

abstract = {Expansionary macroeconomic policy is ineffective because, according to the policy ineffectiveness hypothesis (PIH), which is based on the rational expectations hypothesis (REH), it does not affect the real economy. This conclusion is false for several reasons. In their critique on Keynes' theory, Lucas and Sargent (1978) argue that economic agents erroneously react with positive output and labor supply responses to expansionary macroeconomic policy. But they learn the long-run solution of the Lucas/Sargent model, which involves price reactions only, and do not repeat their mistakes when again confronted with expansionary macroeconomic policy. Thus, learning makes expansionary macroeconomic policy in the Lucas/Sargent model ineffective. The PIH is derived from models based on neoclassical micro-foundations where economic agents optimize in a stationary environment in 'logical time.' Experiencing and learning in 'logical time'? In this paper, we take historical time seriously; that is, we investigate what economic agents actually experience regarding the effectiveness of expansionary macroeconomic policy in 'historical time.' We conclude that even if neoclassical micro-foundations are rigorously applied, if economic agents behave as assumed in the Lucas/Sargent model but that they move through time, the economy will not settle at the predicted long run equilibrium. Instead expansionary macroeconomic policy will be perceived as a virtue.},

@article{Lucas1979,
abstract = {For the applied economist, the confident and appar- ently successful application of Keynesian principles to economic policy which occurred in the United States in the 1960s was an event of incomparable significance and satisfaction. These principles led to a set of simple, quantitative relationships between fiscal policy and economic activity generally, the ba- sic logic of which could be (and was) explained to the general public and which could be applied to yield improvements in economic performance benefitting everyone. It seemed an economics as free of ideologi- cal difficulties as, say, applied chemistry or physics, promising a straightforward expansion in economic possibilities. One might argue as to how this windfall should be distributed, but it seemed a simple lapse of logic to oppose the windfall itself. Understandably and correctly, noneconomists met this promise with skepticism at first; the smoothly growing prosperity of the Kennedy-Johnson years did much to diminish these doubts. We dwell on these halcyon days of Keynesian economics because without conscious effort they are difficult to recall today. In the present decade, the U.S. economy has undergone its first major depression since the 1930s, to the accompaniment of inflation rates in excess of 10 percent per annum. These events have been transmitted (by consent of the governments involved) to other advanced countries and in many cases have been amplified. These events did not arise from a reactionary reversion to outmoded, "classical" principles of tight money and balanced budgets. On the contrary, they were accompanied by massive government budget deficits and high rates of monetary expansion, policies which, although bear- ing an admitted risk of inflation, promised according to modern Keynesian doctrine rapid real growth and low rates of unemployment. That these predictions were wildly incorrect and that the doctrine on which they were based is fun- damentally flawed are now simple matters of fact involving no novelties in economic theory. The task now facing contemporary students of the business cycle is to sort through the wreckage, determining which features of that remarkable intellectual event called the Keynesian Revolution can be salvaged and put to good use and which others must be discarded. Though it is far from clear what the outcome of this process will be, it is already evident that it will neces- sarily involve the reopening of basic issues in mone- tary economics which have been viewed since the thirties as "closed" and the reevaluation of every aspect of the institutional framework within which monetary and fiscal policy is formulated in the ad- vanced countries. This paper is an early progress report on this process of reevaluation and reconstruction. We begin by reviewing the econometric framework by means of which Keynesian theory evolved from disconnected, qualitative talk about economic activity into a system of equations which can be compared to data in a systematic way and which provide an operational guide in the necessarily quantitative task of formulat- ing monetary and fiscal policy. Next, we identify those aspects of this framework which were central to its failure in the seventies. In so doing, our intent is to establish that the difficulties are fatal: that modern macroeconomic models are of no value in guiding policy and that this condition will not be remedied by modifications along any line which is currently being pursued. This diagnosis suggests certain principles which a useful theory of business cycles must have. We conclude by reviewing some recent research con- sistent with these principles.},
