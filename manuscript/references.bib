abstract = {Combining deep model-free reinforcement learning with on-line planning is a promising approach to building on the successes of deep RL. On-line planning with look-ahead trees has proven successful in environments where transition models are known a priori. However, in complex environments where transition models need to be learned from data, the deficiencies of learned models have limited their utility for planning. To address these challenges, we propose TreeQN, a differentiable, recursive, tree-structured model that serves as a drop-in replacement for any value function network in deep RL with discrete actions. TreeQN dynamically constructs a tree by recursively applying a transition model in a learned abstract state space and then aggregating predicted rewards and state-values using a tree backup to estimate Q-values. We also propose ATreeC, an actor-critic variant that augments TreeQN with a softmax layer to form a stochastic policy network. Both approaches are trained end-to-end, such that the learned model is optimised for its actual use in the tree. We show that TreeQN and ATreeC outperform n-step DQN and A2C on a box-pushing task, as well as n-step DQN and value prediction networks (Oh et al. 2017) on multiple Atari games. Furthermore, we present ablation studies that demonstrate the effect of different auxiliary losses on learning transition models.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hamilton depression rating scale (HAMD) subscales provide an economic alternative for the full scale; however, their ability to detect onset of improvement in the early course of treatment (EI) has not yet been researched. The present study investigated in patients with major depression (MD) whether the subscales are a comparable option to predict treatment remission in the early course of treatment.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Based on data from 210 MD patients of a 6-week randomised, placebo-controlled trial comparing mirtazapine (MIR) and paroxetine (PAR), the discriminative and predictive validity of EI for (stable) remission at treatment end was evaluated for seven subscales and the HAMD17 in the total and in treatment subgroups (MIR vs. PAR). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves (at week 2) and the Clinical Global Impression scales (CGI) (at study endpoint) were used to validate the 20{\%} EI criterion for the subscales.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Only the Evans6 and Toronto7 subscale had almost the same predictive value as the HAMD17 (e.g., sensitivities stable remission Evans6/Toronto7: 96/95{\%} vs. 96{\%} HAMD17). The optimal cut-off for EI to predict remission was just below 20{\%} for most subscales and slightly over 20{\%} for stable remission.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLIMITATIONS: Study sample representativeness, non-independence of subscales, missing external validation criterion, lack of control group.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The Evans6 and Toronto7 subscales are valuable alternatives in situations, where economic aspects play a larger role. A sum score reduction of ≥20{\%} as definition for EI seems also appropriate for the HAMD subscales, in the total as well as in the antidepressant subgroups.},

@article{Aubin2002,
abstract = {Between the late 1960s and the beginning of the 1980s, the wide recognition that simple dynamical laws could give rise to complex behaviors was sometimes hailed as a true scientific revolution impacting several disciplines, for which a striking label was coined-"chaos." Mathematicians quickly pointed out that the purported revolution was relying on the abstract theory of dynamical systems founded in the late 19th century by Henri Poincar{\'{e}} who had already reached a similar conclusion. In this paper, we flesh out the historiographical tensions arising from these confrontations: longue-dur{\'{e}}e history and revolution; abstract mathematics and the use of mathematical techniques in various other domains. After reviewing the historiography of dynamical systems theory from Poincar{\'{e}} to the 1960s, we highlight the pioneering work of a few individuals (Steve Smale, Edward Lorenz, David Ruelle). We then go on to discuss the nature of the chaos phenomenon, which, we argue, was a conceptual reconfiguration as much as a sociodisciplinary convergence. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

This switching strategy can be related to the so-called Parrondian games, where the alternation of two losing games yield a winning game. Hence we can consider two dynamics that, by themselves, yield undesirable behaviors, but when alternated yield a desirable oscillatory behavior. In this case, we also consider a noisy switching strategy and find that the desirable oscillatory behavior prevails. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
